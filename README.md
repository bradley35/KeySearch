# KeySearch
This was my project for a science research class I took last year.

I was investigating whether I could use Machine Learning to identity people's typing profiles. Volunteers typed a predetermined passage that contained the word "and" 50 times while their keypstrokes were logged. These presses were then trained against other voltuneers' to determine whether they were identifiable.

This repository contains the interface I used to collect data and the program I used to analyze it.
I have removed the csv files I collected from other volunteers to maintain privacy.
