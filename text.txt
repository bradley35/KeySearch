Once upon a time, in the land of Bandlakand, there was an old mother who had three little pandas and not enough candy to feed them.
So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.
The first little panda was very lazy and small. He didn't want to work at all and built his house out of straw.
The second little panda worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks.
Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.
The third little panda worked hard all day and built his house with bricks.
It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney.
It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.
The next day, a mandrill happened to pass by the land where the three little pandas lived; and he saw on the sand the straw house, and he smelled the panda inside. He thought the panda would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water. So he knocked on the door and said:
"Little panda! Little panda! Let me in! Let me in!"
But the little panda saw the mandrill's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:
"No! No! No! Not by the sand on my chinny chin chin!"
And then the mandrill showed his teeth and said:
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down."
So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down!
The mandrill continued across the sand and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pandas inside; and his mouth began to water.
So he knocked on the door and said: "Little pandas! Little pandas! Let me in! Let me in!"
